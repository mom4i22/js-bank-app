# js-bank-app
A JavaScript + HTML Bank-like app
The app has two users -> Jonas S. and Jessica D. Jessica's username is "jd" and her password is 2222 and Jonas' username is "js" and his password is 1111.
They can make transactions like requesting loans and sending money. They can also close their account and 
they will stop existing(until you rerun the app that is, haha).
